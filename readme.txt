====================== Description ===============================

This is a garage opener program written in Swift language using XCode. 
It displays a simple GUI on an iOS app, featuring a Button object that, when pressed, triggers an HTTP request to a local Webiopi server for a 1-second pulse to be sent to a GPIO peg on the Raspberry Pi.
This Raspberry Pi is connected to a relay, which is then triggered by the pulse to send a signal for the garage door to open.
